Please install it using the following command : pip install poetry Then, please install the dependencies using the following command : poetry install Activate the environment using the following command : poetry shell And finally, install the pre-commit hooks using the following command : pre-commit install Running a specific test Running a specific test with the environment activated is as easy as: pytest tests -k test_the_name_of_your_test Running all the tests With the environment activated you can run all of the tests using: pytest tests Setting up pre-commit We strongly recommend you to use pre-commit to manage your hooks. Here is the description of the tool from the official documentation : Git hook scripts are useful for identifying simple issues before submission to code review. We run our hooks on every commit to automatically point out issues in code such as missing semicolons, trailing whitespace, and debug statements. By pointing these issues out before code review, this allows a code reviewer to focus on the architecture of a change while not wasting time with trivial style nitpicks. Please install it using the following command : pre-commit install pre-commit will now run on every commit. If you want to run it manually, you can use the following command : pre-commit run --all-files pre-commit is not mandatory but it is highly recommended. It is a great tool to ensure that your code is clean and that you are not introducing any new issues. It is also a great way to ensure that your code is compliant with the project's standards, and that your pull request will be accepted. Using zsh to auto fetch If you are using zsh and ohmyzsh , you can install git-auto-fetch to automatically fetch the latest changes from the remote repository. Here an example of a .zshrc file with the plugin : plugins=(git python git-auto-fetch git-prompt vscode) GIT_AUTO_FETCH_INTERVAL=1200 # in seconds source $ZSH/oh-my-zsh.sh Find more information on the official repository This is a great way to ensure that you are always working with the latest version of the code. Like pre-commit, it is not mandatory but it is highly recommended. Issues Reading issues Please read the issues page before creating a new issue : * Find a new issue to work on in the page. * If you want to work on an issue, please comment on the issue to let others know that you are working on it.
